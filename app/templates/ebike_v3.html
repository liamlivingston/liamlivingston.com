    <h2 class="mainTextTitle">Motor Kit</h2>

    <p class="mainText">
        For ebike v3.1 I used the same motor kit as my v2 ebike because the new motor I ordered took about 2 months to
        ship. I hit a top speed of around 40mph with the <a href="/projects/batteries#72v_battery_0">72v LFP battery</a>
        and around 35mph with my <a href="/projects/batteries#60v_battery">60v battery</a>.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2 class="mainTextTitle">Upgrades v3.2</h2>
    <p class="mainText">
        For v3.2, I upgraded to a QS205 50H V3 3.5t motor on a 29in mtx rim. For the controller, I used a VECTOR 200
        from Golden Motor because I was able to borrow one from my solar car team.
        <br>
        <br>
        This increased the top speed to around 55mph but only improved the acceleration a bit.
    </p>


    <h2 class="mainTextTitle">Future Plans</h2>
    <p class="mainText">
        I'm going replace the controller with one that is designed for a hub motor as the VECTOR 200 was designed for a
        different type of motor. I'm also going to install a motorcycle style seat and create a external battery mount
        on it to mount my upgraded originally 60v and now 72v battery.
